## milestone Project 
### UX Experience
### This project will be called "Earth's Future"  
#### Our World's Future - Lets maintain our beautiful World 
Statistics and wildlife anyalictics as a guide to how we can readdress the balance and reverse climate change  
resources and links to data and other websites.  
Readdress the balance of population and  Country / Continent and Habitat and Species and how they correlate with each other.
Reverse Climate Change in theory via data correlation and achieving a balanced perspective to try to understand the real world and what can be done to achieve this in practice.


### Earth focus-2 scatter plot
Continent A string like 'Europe' and the Continent is the same as Country. "In the lessons when we parse the results it is either because the data has a string and we want a number or when the data is one timestamp and we want another. A scatterplot is a chart best suited to plotting two numbers against each other so try Area versus Population". As quoted by a tutor on my course. So I am demonstrating a correlation with population verses area, using a scatterplot.

### Earth Focus - population by country/continent and area measurement
I am creating a dynamic dashboard showcasing the data between Country / Continent anI wad Area.

Population Levels and comparisons between countries and Continents. I want the end user to be able to choose different graphs to show the way data interacts and compares.

I am using a combination of my tutorials and libraries to create my graphs. I had selected code from #Stack Overflow to assist with colouring my barcharts.

## Technologies Used
Jquery to demonstrate DOM manipulation
Bootstrap Cosmos to help with styling 
Make graph technologies; Crossfilter / DC / JSon

## Bugs
I have had serious problems with this project and my understanding of java script and how it works.
I really hope to be able to iron these out in time hence the project being unpfrofessional
