## milestone Project 


### UX Experience
### This project will be called "Earth's Future"  
#### Our World's Future - Lets maintain our beautiful World 
Statistics and wildlife anyalictics as a guide to how we can readdress the balance and reverse climate change  
resources and links to data and other websites.  
Readdress the balance of population and  Country / Continent and Habitat and Species and how they correlate with each other.
Reverse Climate Change in theory via data correlation and achieving a balanced perspective to try to understand the real world and what can be done to achieve this in practice.
#### The Cards
create a climate change dataset.
Add data and graphs explaining the data
focus on wildlife and world population and how it is affecting the planet. How we can analyse and understand the data to make positive decisions going forward.
Sustainable cities
Population Control
Saving wildlife from extinction 
by providing and reversing  their dwindling habitats
Respect for wildlife and food sources
Finding solutions 
What are the solutions
Implementing the solutions for planet health

### Earth Focus - population by country/continent and area measurement
I am creating a dynamic dashboard showcasing the data between Country / Continent and Area.

Population Levels and comparisons between countries and Continents. I want the end user to be able to choose different graphs to show the way data interacts and compares.

I am using a combination of my tutorials and libraries to create my graphs. I had selected code from #Stack Overflow to assist with colouring my barcharts.

### Earth focus-2 scatter plot
Continent A string like 'Europe' and the Continent is the same as Country. "In the lessons when we parse the results it is either because the data has a string and we want a number or when the data is one timestamp and we want another. A scatterplot is a chart best suited to plotting two numbers against each other so try Area versus Population". As quoted by a tutor on my course. So I am demonstrating a correlation with population verses area, using a scatterplot.

## Technologies Used
Jquery to demonstrate DOM manipulation
Bootstrap Cosmos to help with styling 
D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS    Allows User to create anything from an HTML table to a Pie chart, from graphs and bar charts to geospatial maps 
Make graph technologies; Crossfilter / DC / JSon

## Bugs
I have had considerable problems with this project and my understanding of java script and how it works.
I really hope to be able to iron these out in time hence the project being unfinished.
I appear to have a lack of understanding on how to manipulate information in the making of the graphs and the calculations involved.
Although, I did manage to go through the modules ok.
Since I am not able to master the making of my graphs - I have decided that I shall be submitting this project minus at least two of them.  I hope that I shall be able to master these issues as I move on in the course.
