### Earth focus part-2 scatter plot

Continent A string like 'Europe' and the Continent is the same as Country. "In the lessons when we parse the results it is either because the data has a string and we want a number or when the data is one timestamp and we want another. A scatterplot is a chart best suited to plotting two numbers against each other so try Area versus Population". As quoted by a tutor on my course. So I am demonstrating a correlation with population verses area, using a scatterplot.

### Earth Focus - population by country/continent and area measurement
I am creating a dynamic dashboard showcasing the data between Country / Continent anI wad Area.

Population Levels and comparisons between countries and Continents. I want the end user to be able to choose different graphs to show the way data interacts and compares.

I am using a combination of my tutorials and libraries to create my graphs. I had selected code from #Stack Overflow to assist with colouring my barcharts.
